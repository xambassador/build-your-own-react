# Miniact
`Miniact` is a playful, educational re-implementation of [`React's`](https://react.dev/) core ideas, aiming to demystify how hooks, fibers, and the virtual DOM come together. This tiny react implementation is not production-ready. It’s a hands-on sandbox for understanding the internals of rendering, reconciliation, and scheduling. By exploring `Miniact` source, you’ll gain insight into the architectural patterns behind React and learn how to build and customize your own UI library from scratch.
